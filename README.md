# Pro-README-Gen
  

  ## Description
  This project is for generating a Professional README. It is done by running node index.js in the terminal and one will be prompted with questions to answer that will then write those answers to a README.md file. 

  This project is great for sharpening JavaScript skills and getting used to using Node.js
